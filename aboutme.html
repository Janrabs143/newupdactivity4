        <h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>My name is John Mateo Raboy, I am 18 years old and I was born on June 21, 
            2007 in Basak, San Nicolas, Cebu City. I am the eldest child in our family.
             My family consists of four members. Our house was small, but it was always full of laughter, music, and food, especially during holidays when the whole extended family came over.</p>

        <p>Since my early school life, I’ve learned discipline, good manners, and obedience from my teachers and parents. In school, I also learned important things like how to write and read, how to work with others, and how to manage my time. These things helped me shape who I am today.</p>

        <p>I've learned that life can be hard sometimes, but we can always learn from it. I learned that it's okay to take time and grow slowly. I also learned that being different is okay. Thrifting, my quiet side, and the things I enjoy make me who I am. Even small efforts every day can help me improve. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm doing my best.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, I think about the people who’ve helped shape me my family, my friends, my teachers, and even strangers I’ve met along the way. Every interaction, big or small, has taught me something. Whether it’s learning how to be kind, how to stand up for myself, or simply how to listen, these lessons have stayed with me. I carry them with me as I continue to grow. I believe that who we become is not just about what we do, but also about the people who walk beside us, even for a short time. That’s why I try my best to be someone others can rely on, even in small ways.</p>

        <p>I'm still growing and learning, but I'm proud of how far I've come. I want to keep improving, stay true to myself, and enjoy the journey. I don't know what the future holds, but I'm excited to find out.</p>
